Written Report for Pandas Homework: PyCity Schools 

After viewing the scores grouped by school type, it seems that the Charter schools’ students perform better than those in District school. After viewing the top five performing schools and the bottom five performing schools, the data supports this hypothesis. 

I thought that maybe the budget per student would influence the student’s performance, thinking the more the school could spend on a student the better the performance, however there is not a different between the two performing schools and the lower performing schools. I did notice more of a trend between school size and performance. With the top schools having a smaller group of students, and the bottom school with larger student groups. This is also backed up by group the data based on school size, as the schools with more than 2000 students on average scored lower. All the bottom performing school all schools with more than 2000 students. There is one excepting in the top performing school, Wilson High School with 2283 students. If I worked for a school district and saw this data, I would see what factors at Wilson is creating the students’ success and try to implement these practices to the other larger schools to help increase student performance.
